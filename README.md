## P5LeapMotion Utils ##
This repo contains couple of utilities which can be used with LeapMotion. However, LeapMotionP5 library by onformative
is a pre-requisite for both of these sketches as they are written on top of these wrapper classes. Please visit, 
[LeapMotionP5](https://github.com/onformative/LeapMotionP5) for installation instructions on the library.

By any chance if you are intending to use any of them, I would like to infrom you in advance that this repo doesn't home 
the neatest of code. Also if you have any feedback or questions, [file an issue here](https://github.com/hamzeen/P5LeapMotion/issues/new) and 
I will try to get back to you when I can.

### Here are the descriptions for both sketches:
*   leap_tuio is a simple driver which is written following TUIO specification that allows to get LeapMotion finger tip points to Multi-Touch applications which support support TUIO input.
*   slide is a utility that allows to use LeapMotion's *SwipeRight*, *SwipeLeft* gestures to switch between slides on a presentation or to browse through a PDF.
